# Decision Log

All architectural decisions made during Ariadne development.

## D-001: Structural Topology via Rust CLI + Tree-sitter

**Date:** 2026-03-17
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Need a tool that builds structural dependency graphs from source code. Must work across languages, be fast, produce deterministic output, and have zero runtime dependencies.
**Decision:** Standalone Rust binary using tree-sitter for AST-based parsing. Single binary distribution. JSON output format. No LLM involvement — purely deterministic static analysis.
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Agent-driven parsing (LLM reads files) — expensive in tokens, non-deterministic, slow on large projects
- Regex-based parsing — fragile, doesn't scale across languages
- Language-specific tools (tsc, go vet, etc.) — requires each tool installed, inconsistent output formats
- SQLite storage — unnecessary for deterministic data that doesn't need complex queries beyond what JSON provides
**Reasoning:** Tree-sitter provides accurate AST-based parsing for 100+ languages with zero token cost. Rust gives single-binary distribution with fastest execution (3000 files in 1-3s).

## D-002: Language Support via Tree-sitter Trait

**Date:** 2026-03-17
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Must work across any tech stack. Need extensible language support without per-language complexity explosion.
**Decision:** Each language implements a `LanguageParser` trait (extensions, tree-sitter grammar, import/export extraction, path resolution). Tier 1 (initial): TypeScript/JavaScript, Go, Python, Rust, C#, Java. Tier 2 (future): Kotlin, Swift, C/C++, PHP, Ruby, Dart. Adding a language = implementing one trait + adding grammar crate dependency.
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Universal regex parser — too fragile for edge cases
- Single monolithic parser — violates extensibility, hard to test per-language
**Reasoning:** Trait-based design keeps each language isolated and testable. 6 Tier 1 languages cover ~85% of projects.

## D-003: Graceful Degradation

**Date:** 2026-03-17
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Files may fail to parse (syntax errors, unsupported features). The tool should still produce useful output.
**Decision:** Unparseable files are logged to stderr and excluded from the graph. Exit code remains 0 (success with warnings). The graph is useful with some files missing. Fatal errors (no parseable files, invalid project root) exit with code 1.
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Fail on first error — breaks usability on real projects with occasional syntax issues
- Silent skip — violates transparency (user doesn't know files were missed)
**Reasoning:** Real projects have files that don't parse cleanly. The graph should be best-effort, with transparent reporting of what was skipped.

## D-004: Separate Project from Moira

**Date:** 2026-03-17
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Ariadne was originally designed as `moira-graph`, a component of the Moira orchestration framework. However, the tool has no dependency on Moira's infrastructure and uses a completely different tech stack (Rust vs shell/markdown).
**Decision:** Ariadne is a standalone project with its own repository, CI/CD, versioning, and release cycle. Moira integration (Phase 15 in Moira's roadmap) happens on Moira's side — shell wrappers invoke the `ariadne` CLI. Ariadne has zero knowledge of Moira.
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Subdirectory in Moira repo — GitHub Actions doesn't work from nested `.github/`, `cargo install` doesn't work from subdirectory, Rust toolchain not needed for core Moira
- Git submodule — worst of both approaches
**Reasoning:** Clean separation enables: standard `cargo install ariadne`, native CI/CD, independent releases. The tool is useful beyond Moira — any system that needs structural code analysis can use it.

## D-005: Error Handling Strategy — Best-Effort with Structured Warnings

**Date:** 2026-03-17
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Source projects contain broken files, binary files, permission-restricted files, huge generated bundles, non-UTF-8 content, and other edge cases. The tool must handle all of these without crashing.
**Decision:** Two-tier error model: Fatal errors (E001-E005) stop execution immediately (exit 1). Recoverable errors (W001-W009) skip the affected file and emit a structured warning to stderr. Warnings have codes (W001-W009) and support human and JSON output formats. Resource limits (max file size 1MB, max files 50k) prevent memory exhaustion. Partial tree-sitter parses extract from valid subtrees. Output files are written atomically (temp + rename). `--strict` flag makes warnings fatal for CI use.
**Alternatives rejected:**
- Fail on any error — unusable on real projects
- Silent skip — user doesn't know what's missing from the graph
- Log file — adds complexity, stderr is standard for warnings
**Reasoning:** Real projects are messy. Best-effort graph with transparent warnings gives the most value. Structured warning codes enable machine consumption. Resource limits prevent pathological inputs from causing OOM. Atomic writes prevent corruption on interruption.
